# Openwrt-Bluetooth-C-Header-Files

Header files from 5.50 Bluez source code. They are useful for python 2.7 pybluez in Openwrt. pybluez contains c code files which reference (#include) bluetooth header files. Try to __pip install pybluez__ and you will likely get compilation errors, that is because compiler is trying to make an internal bluetooth.so library for python but can't find bluetooth header files. Before doing __pip install pybluez__ the system needs installing Openwrt bluez-libs (v 5.50-5) package because it contains the external library (/usr/lib/libbluetooth.so.3.18.16) which is linked with the above compilation. Successful pybluez installation done on DLINK DIR 505 (mips_24kc) with OpenWrt 19.07.4, r11208-ce6496d796.
